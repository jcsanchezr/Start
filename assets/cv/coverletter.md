Forschungszentrum Jülich  

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am eager to express my strong interest in the **HPC / Cloud / Network or Data Systems Engineer** position at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre. With a solid foundation in mathematics and programming skills in languages such as C++ and Rust, along with hands-on experience in high-performance computing (HPC) systems and cloud technologies, I am thrilled about the chance to contribute to JSC’s groundbreaking efforts in the realm of exascale computing.

In my career, I have developed a diverse skill set in designing, implementing, and documenting software solutions for complex systems. Specifically, my experience includes developing simulation environments and tools for interdisciplinary analysis, allowing me to optimize software solutions for large-scale projects and ensure efficient data processing. I am confident that my expertise aligns well with JSC’s mission to push supercomputing in Europe to the next level.

I have developed strong expertise in **Linux environments** and have sharpened my skills in **Python** for scripting and automation tasks. Recently, I've been diving deep into **Rust**, which has enhanced my ability to create highly efficient and safe system-level code, an invaluable asset for meeting the demands of JSC's advanced infrastructure. Moreover, I possess knowledge in **system tuning** and benchmarking, both of which are crucial for optimizing the performance of HPC and cloud systems.

Beyond my technical skills, I am committed to clear and comprehensive documentation and to facilitating collaboration within interdisciplinary teams. My experience working on large-scale projects has reinforced my ability to work systematically while balancing performance and accuracy, all key traits for the role at JSC.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity at JSC due to its dedication to advancing scientific computing in Europe and its emphasis on cutting-edge HPC, cloud, and data systems. I look forward to the chance to contribute my expertise in system optimization, HPC tools, and cloud infrastructure management to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my skills and experiences align with JSC’s goals in further detail. I have attached my resume for your review, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to JSC’s mission.

Sincerely,  
José Cruz Sánchez Ramírez
