# Welcome to My World of Innovation and Science

I’m **José Cruz Sánchez Ramírez**, a scientist, technologist, and innovator dedicated to making science accessible to everyone. My journey combines a solid foundation in mathematics with a dynamic career spanning quantum computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, and heterogeneous computing. I believe in the power of science and technology to create meaningful change, and I’m constantly driven by the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.

In 2016, I founded **ACIATII** (Association of Scientific Artists and Technologists for Innovation and Research), a civil association where we bridge the worlds of science, technology, and art to push the boundaries of knowledge. Through ACIATII, I lead initiatives that harness AI, IoT, and robotics to develop impactful solutions across various fields.
